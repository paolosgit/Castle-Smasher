# Castle-Smasher
A simple, point and click game in C++, using SFML

To further elaborate, SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a graphics library that can be used to make visual creations
using C++.

In this repository, I want to showcase my simple game I call "Castle Smasher". Where, you have 20 seconds to point an click to 
smash as many children's castles as you can in that time. 

For a demonstration, please use this Youtube link: https://youtu.be/o7u4XCS5Wpw
